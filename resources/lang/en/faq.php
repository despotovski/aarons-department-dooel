NFTs are easily collected and traded. It is, for example, much easier to resell an NFT than it is to resell a physical object.
In addition, the ownership of NFTs is indisputable and as ownership passes from one person to another, it creates an interesting history and provenance, which is more complicated to achieve with physical assets.
Next to being a fun new way to own assets, NFT ownership allows your assets to exist over the long term (on the blockchain) unlike physical assets, which will fade over time.',
